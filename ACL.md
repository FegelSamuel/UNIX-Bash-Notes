__ACL- Access Control Lists (IT'S A FILE)__
Like the usual permissions list for Linux and stuff, but is very specifically for one file or directory, depending on the type of rule.

Access Rule: Directory or File
Default Rule: Directory Only

Need to download ACL package 
'grep home etc/fstab'

'setfacl' - set the ACL for a given file or directory
'getfacl' - displays ACL for a given file or directory
