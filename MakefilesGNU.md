# Introduction
* This is the UT Dallas CS student's first official introduction to writing a script in one of their courses.
* Makefiles are a GNU utility that determines which pieces of a large program need to be compiled or recompiled.
* You can basically script your makefile to create and link your programs and headers without manually typing everything in like a chump.

# Example from Slides
```makefile
#Makefile for “textr” C++ application 
PROG = textr
CC = g++
CPPFLAGS = -g –Wall –I/usr/class/cs193d/textrInc
LDFLAGS = -L/usr/class/cs193/lib –lCoolFns
OBJS = main.o blurb.o database.o
$(PROG) : $(OBJS)
        $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o $(PROG) $(OBJS)
main.o :
        $(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) -c main.cpp
blurb.o :  blurb.h
        $(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) -c blurb.cpp
database.o : database.h
        $(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) -c database.cpp
clean:
        rm -f core $(PROG) $(OBJS)
        # If you're wondering about what `core` means, it's basically if core dumps are enabled, a `core` file will be created to log crashes and stuff
```


# Vocab
## Target 
* Usually the name of an executable or object file that is generated by g++, but it can also be the name of an action to carry out.
## Prerequisites
* A list of files needed to create the target. If one of these files have changed, then the make utility knows that it has to build the target file again. 
* Also called “dependencies.”
## Action
* An action that make carries out, usually a g++ compilation or linking command.
* In make, commands are run and generate output just as if they were entered one by one into the UNIX prompt.
## Macro-Variables
* Basically you can assign a string to a variable so you can type a shorthand version for some really long file name.


```makefile
# This is a rule. It explains how and when to make or remake a target
target ... : prerequisites ...
  command1 # ALL COMMANDS NEED A TAB (\t escape char) BEFORE BEING TYPED
  command2
  command3
  ...
```

* A `make` call executes the first rule by default. For other rules, type `make <target>`


# Comment Convention
```makefile
# At the top of your makefile script, talk about what your makefile is for. It should be only for one project
