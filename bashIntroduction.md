# Test
Let's say we make a file named `test`
```bash
# this is a basic shell script
who | wc -l
```
In the terminal, I will run
```bash
sh test
```
```bash
bash test
```
`who | wc -l` will run in the terminal
You can also run `chmod 100` on `test` to make it executable (1~~ can be any odd octal number)
